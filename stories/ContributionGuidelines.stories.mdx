# Contribution guidelines

Pull requests are welcome! The best way to develop a cloned react-form-component
repo before committing any change is to import and use it on a local react
project. It can be done with help of yarn link functionality. All peer
dependencies must be linked:

```
cd YOUR_CLONNED_REACT-FORM-COMPONENT_FORK
yarn link
yarn install
cd node_modules/react
yarn link
cd ../react-dom
yarn link

cd YOUR_REACT_PROJECT
yarn link react-form-component
yarn link react
yarn link react-dom
```

To apply changes introduced in a source core, run `yarn build`.

Make sure you use the version of Node mentioned in `.nvmrc` file.
