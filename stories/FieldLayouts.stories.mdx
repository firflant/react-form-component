# Field layouts

**React Form Component** provides some features to compose a form into various
layouts, so you do not need to put additional styles.

### Inline label

By default, field label is displayed above the field. You can move it to left by
adding the `inlineLabel` prop to a particular field. Inline label will always
have the same width, which is configurable in a
[theme](/?path=/docs/docs-form-layouts--page#default-theme).

### Fields in one row

To combine multiple fields into one row, put them into `<FormRow>` component.
Wrapped fields will be displayed one after one with a proper gap in between. On
smaller screens they will keep the default, column behavior.

### Inputs in _Subscribe box_ style.

To combine elements into one row, where all elements are the same height, do not
have a gutter or a border radius in between, put them into `<Compound>`
component. The common usage example of this component is a combination of email
input with _Subscribe_ button of a subscribe form.

### Form action buttons group

Wrap `<FormButton>` and other action buttons into `<FormActions>` component to
position them accordingly and move them away from the fields above.
