# Field layouts

**React Form Component** provides some features to compose a form into various
layouts, so you do not need to put additional styles.

## Inline label

By default, field label is displayed above the field. You can move it to left by
adding the `inlineLabel` prop to a particular field. Inline label will always
have the same width, which is configurable in
[theme](/?path=/docs/docs-form-layouts--page#default-theme).

## Layout components

In the *Components/Various* chapter there are some components, that are wrappers
for fields, that puts them into various layouts:

- [**Row**](?path=/docs/components-layouts-row--example)
- [**Compound**](?path=/docs/components-layouts-compound--example)
- [**FormActions**](?path=/docs/components-layouts-formactions--example)
