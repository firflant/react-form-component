# Concept

## Form

`<Form>` component indicates that "**Hey, this is a scope of particular form and
all its children fields of given names, are fields of that form**". The Form
component does not provide any rendered output by itself, except the `<form>` tag.
But as the name suggests, is a core of whole library. It stores and updates the
state of all fields, handles validation and formats a data for submit functions.

Example, how to use Form component to say "Hey, this is a form with username and
role fields".

<Canvas withSource='open'>
  <Story name='Form example'>
    {FormTemplate.bind({})}
  </Story>
</Canvas>

Because fields are paired with Form by a *name* string, the name of each field
must stay unique.

To get familiar with all props, see documentation of [Form component](?path=/docs/components-form--example)


## Fields

If you would go into **React Form Component** source code, you may notice that
each input component is wrapped into **withFormControl** *HOC* (*Higher Order
Component*). This is a second core part of this library. It has two purposes.
At first, it communicates with ancestor Form component. Beside this, it adds
surronding UI elements, like label, help, prefix and suffix.

The combination of **Input** component wrapped into **FormControl** is
called a **Field**.

### Common UI Elements provided for all fields

- **Label** - title of a field, displayed before the input
- **Input** - the input itself
- **Help** - help text under a field, also used to display error messages

Beside these, all inputs of text type, like *Input*, *TextArea*, *Select*,
*MultiSelect*, may additionaly utilize following elements:

- **Prefix** - a symbol, icon or unit at the beginning of input (✨)
- **Suffix** - the same, but at the end of input (€)

Below is an example of a complete **Field** with all elements in use:

<Canvas withSource='open'>
  <Story name='Field elements'>
    {FieldTemplate.bind({})}
  </Story>
</Canvas>

> For inputs of other types, like Radio, Checkbox, ImageUpload, these elements
> won't work correctly.


### Common input props

Because every input provided by React Form Component is wrapped into
withFormControl, it gains following props:

| Prop           | Type          | Description                                 |
|----------------|---------------|---------------------------------------------|
| name           | *string*      | Field identifier unique for a form.         |
| label          | *string*      | Field label.                                |
| initialValue   | *bool/string* | Default value of a field.                   |
| help           | *string*      | Text displayed under a field.               |
| noBottomGutter | *bool*        | Disables the bottom margin.                 |
| inlineLabel    | *bool*        | Move label from top to left.                |
| disabled       | *bool*        | Turns off the interaction with field.       |
| className      | *string*      | Give input control wrapper a class.         |
| prefix         | *node*        | Only for inputs of text type.               |
| suffix         | *node*        | Only for inputs of text type.               |

As mentioned in previous chapter, the name prop is crucial. All others
are optional.
