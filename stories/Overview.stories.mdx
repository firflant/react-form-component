# Overview

**React Form Component** has been created to be a complete, independent solution
for building forms in React in a rapid, but flexible way. Beside other form
libraries, it ships both build in **Form State Management** system and a well
structurized, extendable framework of compatible **Form UI Components**. This
default framework has [configurable theme](/?path=/docs/docs-theming--page),
which makes it flexible to match your design and functionality. So instead of a
writing complex logic for all form interactions, and all forms one after one,
it keeps developer focus on writing JSX code of a form, by building it from
ready, smart components.

Another usage of **React Form Component** is to be only a state management tool
for form components of your design system, regardless it is *Material UI*,
*Ant Design*, or any custom one. Using default components of this library is
opional and declaring custom inputs, compatible with *Form State Management*
is very simple - thanks to [withFormControl](/?path=/docs/docs-custom-inputs--page)
Higher Order Component.

## What Form State Managemen does?

- compose values of all fields into one object, formatted well for API calls
- fields validation
- handles mandatory/optional fields
- handles success states, error state and error messages
- provides various methods on handling submit action
- allows to set initial form state

## Advantages of built-in Form UI Components

- flexible theme
- miminalistic DOM
- cross browser tested
- covers most common cases
- behavior custimizable by various props
- field groups

## Manifest

Learning curve of building forms in React should be lowered.
The code of react forms is too repetitive.
There shouldn't be a form impossible to creatie with **React Form Component**.
