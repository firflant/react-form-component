# Overview

**React Form Component** has been created to be a complete, independent solution
for building forms in React. Beside the other form libraries, it ships both a
 simple to learn **Form State Management** system and extendable framework of
default **Form UI Components**. This compatible design system has
[configurable theme](?path=/docs/docs-theming--page), which makes it flexible
enough to match most design and functionality scenarios. So instead of writing
complex logic for all form interactions, it keeps developer focused on JSX code
of a form, by building it from ready, smart components.

Logic in **React Form Component** is so strictly separated from UI, that the
library can act just as a dependency for form components of any design system, to
simplify its usage. Regardless it is *Material UI*, *Ant Design*, or any other.
Using default components is opional and declaring custom inputs, compatible with
*Form State Management* is as simple, as wrapping into dedicated
[withFormControl](?path=/docs/docs-custom-inputs--page) Higher Order Component.

## What Form State Managemen does?

- submits values from all fields as one object, well formatted for API calls,
- fields validation,
- allows to set initial field values,
- handles mandatory fields,
- handles success states, error state and error messages,
- provides various ways for triggering submit action.

## Advantages of built-in Form UI Components

- flexible theme,
- miminalistic DOM,
- cross-browser tested,
- covers all most common design scenarios,
- inputs behavior is custimizable by various props,
- allows to build nested structure of a form.

## Manifest

Learning curve of building forms in React should be lowered.
The code of react forms is too repetitive.
There shouldn't be a form impossible to creatie with **React Form Component**.

Enough of words. [Let's see some code](?path=/docs/introduction-getting-started--getting-started).
